# COVID-19 Contact Tracing Backend Specification

> This specification is featured in [COVID-19 Tracker Apps and Apple Google Contact TracingÂ API - The need for interoperability and standardisation](https://medium.com/@kristijan.cvetkovic/covid-19-tracker-apps-and-apple-google-contact-tracing-api-ed9983ea049a) and published as early draft version and will be subject to Subject to modification and extension. Please consider it as invitiation to conversation

## Design Goals

The main goal of this specification is to assist COVID-19 Tracking apps which are using the recently published Apple/Google Contact Tracing API in answering key architectual such as

- How does an app pull published diagnosis keys?
- Who is allowed to pull the published diagnosis keys?
- When and how often shall apps pull diagnosis keys?
- How does an app push its diagnosis keys in case of of a positive diagnosis?
- How is the push of diagnosis keys secured to prevent pranksters and fraud attempts?
- Where and how are the diagnosis keys stored?
- What data needs to be stored in the cloud beside the diagnosis keys?
- How can apps of different developers share diagnosis keys?

## Actors

The main actors in the context of this specification are:

| Actor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| App Developer | Developer of a COVID-19 Tracking app |
| User | End user who install their preferred COVID-19 Tracking app on their device |
| Health Authority | official institution, which conducts COVID-19 tests and informs users about a positive diagnosis |
| Contact Tracing Backend Provider | Developer or hoster of a Contact Tracing Backend Instance |
| Contact Tracing Backend Authority | Owner of the single Contact Tracing Backend Registry |
| Data analyst | Data analyst, who use published diagnosis keys for research |



## Components

The main components in the context of this specification are:

| Actor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| App | COVID-19 Tracker app developed and published by app developers |
| OS | Android and iOS devices with enabled Contact Tracing API |
| Contact Tracing Backend | instance of a running Contact Tracing Backend according to this specification |
